# Problem Statement

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects older adults and leads to cognitive decline, memory loss, and impaired daily functioning. It is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for 60-80% of dementia cases worldwide. Despite decades of research, the exact causes of Alzheimer’s remain unclear, though it is associated with abnormal deposits of proteins, such as amyloid plaques and tau tangles, in the brain. These protein accumulations interfere with neuronal communication, ultimately leading to cell death.

The growing prevalence of Alzheimer’s poses a significant public health challenge, with an estimated 50 million people affected globally, and this number is expected to triple by 2050 due to aging populations. The disease has profound effects not only on patients but also on caregivers, families, and healthcare systems, leading to significant emotional, social, and economic burdens.

Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, and existing treatments only provide temporary relief from symptoms without halting disease progression. Early diagnosis is also challenging due to the gradual onset of symptoms and the need for more reliable biomarkers. This underscores an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches, early detection methods, and better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Addressing Alzheimer's disease requires interdisciplinary efforts across neurology, pharmacology, biotechnology, and healthcare policy.
